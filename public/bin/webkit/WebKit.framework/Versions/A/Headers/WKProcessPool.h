/*! A WKProcessPool object represents a pool of web content processes.
 The process pool associated with a web view is specified by its web view
 configuration. Each web view is given its own web content process until an
 implementation-defined process limit is reached; after that, web views
 with the same process pool end up sharing web content processes.
